[Verse]

<span>G</span>              <span>D</span>            <span>Am</span>
Mama take this badge off of me
<span>G</span>       <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>
I can't use it any-more
<span>G</span>            <span>D</span>                        <span>Am</span>
It's getting dark, too dark for me to see
<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>                   <span>C</span>   
I feel I'm knockin on heaven's door


[Chorus]

<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>                    <span>Am</span>
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>                    <span>C</span>   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>                    <span>Am</span>
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>                    <span>C</span>   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door


[Verse]

<span>G</span>           <span>D</span>           <span>Am</span>
Mama put my guns in the ground
<span>G</span>       <span>D</span>              <span>C</span>
I can't shoot them any-more
<span>G</span>               <span>D</span>               <span>Am</span>
That long black cloud is comin' down
<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>                    <span>C</span>   
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door


[Chorus]

<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>                    <span>Am</span>
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>                    <span>C</span>   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>                    <span>Am</span>
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>                    <span>C</span>   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door


[Outro]

<span>G</span>    <span>D</span>        <span>Am</span>       
Oo - oo - oo  oo . . .
