[Verse]

<span>Dm</span>                         (<span>Dm</span>,(<span>Dm</span>))
We don't need no education 
<span>Dm</span>                               (<span class="">Dm</span>,(<span>Dm</span>))
We don’t need no thought control
<span>Dm</span>                                (<span>Dm</span>,(<span>Dm</span>))                   
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
<span>Dm</span>                              <span>G</span>
Teachers leave them kids alone
                               <span>Dm</span>
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!


[Chorus]

<span>F</span>                     <span>C</span>                   <span>Dm</span>    (Dm,(Dm))
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
<span>F</span>                       <span>C</span>                   <span>Dm</span>   
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
