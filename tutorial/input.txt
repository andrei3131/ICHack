[Verse 1]
<span class="">D</span>           <span class="">A</span>                <span class="">Bm</span>
  See the stone set in your eyes
          <span class="">G</span>                  <span class="">D</span>
See the thorn twist in your side
   <span>A</span>        <span>Bm</span>   <span class="">G</span>
I wait for you
<span>D</span>             <span class="">A</span>                <span>Bm</span>
  Sleight of hand and twist of fate
              <span>G</span>                 <span>D</span>
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
       <span>A</span>        <span>Bm</span>       <span class="">G</span>
And I wait, without you

[Chorus]
            <span>D</span>            <span>A</span>
With or without you
            <span>Bm</span>           <span>G</span>
With or without you

[Verse 2]
<span>D</span>               <span>A</span>                 <span>Bm</span>
  Through the storm we reach the shore
            <span>G</span>               <span>D</span>
You give it all but I want more
         <span>A</span>      <span>Bm</span>        <span>G</span>
And I’m waiting for you

[Chorus]
            <span>D</span>         <span>A</span>
With or without you
           <span>Bm</span>          <span>G</span>
With or without you
         <span>D</span>     <span>A</span>
I can’t live
            <span>Bm</span>       <span>G</span>
With or without you

[Instrumental]
<span>D</span> <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>G</span>

[Bridge]
         <span>D</span>             <span>A</span>
And you give yourself away
         <span>Bm</span>            <span>G</span>
And you give yourself away
         <span>D</span>
And you give
         <span>A</span>
And you give
         <span>Bm</span>            <span>G</span>
And you give yourself away

[Verse 3]
<span>D</span>               <span>A</span>
  My hands are tied
<span>Bm</span>         <span>G</span>                    <span>D</span>
 My body bruised, she's got me with
            <span>A</span>
Nothing to win and
<span>Bm</span>               <span>G</span>
Nothing left to lose

[Bridge]
         <span>D</span>             <span>A</span>
And you give yourself away
         <span>Bm</span>            <span>G</span>
And you give yourself away
         <span>D</span>
And you give
         <span>A</span>
And you give
         <span>Bm</span>            <span>G</span>
And you give yourself away

[Chorus]
            <span>D</span>         <span>A</span>
With or without you
           <span>Bm</span>          <span>G</span>
With or without you
         <span>D</span>     <span>A</span>
I can’t live
            <span>Bm</span>       <span>G</span>
With or without you

[Interlude]
<span>D</span>            <span>A</span>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
<span>Bm</span>         <span>G</span>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
<span>D</span>            <span>A</span>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
<span>Bm</span>         <span>G</span>
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
            <span>D</span>         <span>A</span>
With or without you
           <span>Bm</span>          <span>G</span>
With or without you
         <span>D</span>     <span>A</span>
I can’t live
            <span>Bm</span>       <span>G</span>
With or without you
            <span>D</span>
With or without you

[Outro]
<span>D</span> <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>G</span>
<span>D</span> <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>G</span>
<span>D</span> <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>G</span>
<span>D</span> <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>G</span>
